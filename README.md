sqli (as in, "sql" + "cli" = "sqli") is a simple & sleek SQL client, used as a terminal UI or as a command line tool, to help you query your Postgres database!

heavily inspired by tools like [posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting), [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), and [bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno).
