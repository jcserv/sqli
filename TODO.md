- [ ] collections
- [ ] command palette and keyboard navigation
- [ ] autocomplete based on tables within a database

## random notes
- collections are a group of sql files, represented by a directory
- collections can be run against any connection
    two scopes:
        - user (~/.config/sqli/collections/<collection_name>/...)
        - local (cwd or ./sqli/<collection_name>/...)
- connections are stored in the user config folder
